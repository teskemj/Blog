# Transitioning from WordPress to Github
Welcome to my first attempt at moving away from WordPress and over to github.io. This will be a trial run.

## Motivation
I wanted to increase my blogs post cadence to more than a few posts a year and leverage MarkDown in the process because that's what the cool kids are doing. 

I looked at WP and in order to add the MD plugin, you had to be a Business Plan subscriber at a mere **cough** **cough** $25/month. Welp, that's a bit more than I was hoping to spend, about $25 more in fact. So, I recall seeing a blog post by @MS_dministrator, Josh Rickard about this very topic as he wanted more control over what the free-mium version of WP had to offer. You can find his write-up [here](https://letsautomate.it/article/how-to-setup-a-hugo-website-on-github/ "How to setup a Hugo Website on Github").

## Let's Get Started
I parsed through Josh's write-up and got stuck on a few things. I found my solution by looking at another Hugo theme instructions on GitHub and made an adjustment and viola, we're cooking with gas. So, now I have a very basic GitHub page, with a good start at making my blog postings a bit less painful while leveraging technologies (git/github/source control) which will only help me down the road. 

## What Next?
Josh's write up has some automation built into it using bash. I will take a swing at using PowerShell for my solution. I also need to figure out what domain names I want/can link to this page. I am assuming I should be able to easily modify my DNS records to point to my new hosting location. So, from here on out, [https://www.becausesecurity.com](https://www.becausesecurity.com) should point here.
